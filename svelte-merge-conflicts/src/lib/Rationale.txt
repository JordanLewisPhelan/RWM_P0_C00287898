1- First Commit - Added Branch A's button logic

2- Second Commit - Added Branch B's button logic

3- Third Commit - Big choice, had to choose what logic was better as a base, chose option B as it was more structured and detailed.

4- Fourth Commit - Merged A and B nullifying the choice I made before, just had to deal with VScodes editor, accepted & updated codebase.




NOTICE: Had issues installing and running other editors, could not catch screenshots of using it
Secondly - due to placement of "Files to Include" I did not capture the 3 way merge.
